          Pretty and Polished Farmhouse Kitchen

          Singer-songwriter (and serial renovator) Holly Williams preserved her farmhouse kitchenâ€™s original layout opting only to reconfigure the placement of the refrigerator and cooktop. She coated the walls and trim a crisp white (Delicate White by Porter Paints) and installed ceramic subway tile for added texture. For a slight bit of contrast, she chose light gray cabinets which she paired with open shelving. An inky black ceiling (Tricorn Black by Sherwin-Williams) grounds the room, while patterned roman shades add hints of blue without blocking too much natural light. Rather than undertake a pricey floor restoration, Holly opted to paint the hardwoods a barely there shade of pink (Pink Ground by Farrow & Ball).

          A Handsome Coastal Kitchen

          Marine blue cabinets topped with walnut countertops, a red cedar ceiling (to lend a feeling of being on a boat), and a pine subfloor salvaged from a ca.-1700s tavern in Maine revived Steve Ballerini and Colin Bohrer's small Cape Cod kitchen. Horizontal plank walls and handcrafted unlacquered brass and rope pendants further the nautical vibe.

          Warm & Inviting Kitchen
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
          First up for homeowners Marcus and Victoria Ford (@prepfordwife) was to remove the traffic-blocking peninsula and replace it with a pretty furniture-style end cabinet. Adding shiplap to the ceiling (painted Dutch Tile Blue by Sherwin-Williams) and beadboard to the walls (painted Antique White by Sherwin-Williams) instantly brought warmth and texture to the 1970s space. Patinaed hardware dresses up the new Shaker-front cabinets, while brushed-bronze handles accent matte white appliances, and an unlacquered bridge faucet tops the fluted apron-front sink. Lastly, a small butcher-block topped table adds needed prep and serving space.

          A French Farmhouse Kitchen
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
          Maria Carr (@dreamywhiteslifestyle) The airier space feels significantly larger thanks to crisp ceilings with exposed rafters and wide shiplap planked walls, white cabinets newly crafted from scrap wood, and a sea of marble, including Carrara marble countertops (bedrosians.com), handcrafted marble-and-wood shelving, and a marble subway tile backsplash (emser.com). The couple also replaced linoleum floors with a herringbone patterned alternative in black oak, which they were chagrined to find out has a tendency to turn pink when staining. Thanks to a call for help on Instagram, they found a crowd-sourced solution: Woca oil (wocawoodcare.com) French standbys including ironstone breadboards, vintage baskets, copper pots, and an old French sieve that hangs above the range
